# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the guides and templates for managing a scalable and highly available Moodle on Azure. We welcome your contributions and participation! If you aren't sure what to expect, here are some norms for our project so you feel more comfortable with
how things will go.

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Our goal is to
work on Azure specific tooling for deploying and managing the open
source [Moodle](http://moodle.org) learning management system on
Azure. We do not work on Moodle itself here, instead we work upstream
as appropriate.

## CLA Required

Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do,
grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit
https://cla.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine
whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately
(e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the
bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our
CLA.

## Code of Conduct

This project has adopted the Microsoft [Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/)
or contact opencode@microsoft.com with any additional questions or comments.

Contributions come in many forms: submitting issues, writing code, participating in discussions and community calls.

This document provides the guidelines for how to contribute to this project.
  
## Issues

There are 4 types of issues that you may want to contribute to this project: bugs, discussions, proposals, or questions. 

- Bug: You've found a bug with the code, and want to report it, or create an issue to track the bug.
- Discussion: You have something on your mind, which requires input from others in a discussion, before it eventually manifests as a proposal.
- Proposal: If you want to propose a new idea or functionality. This allows feedback from others before you start working on code.
- Question: If you need support with the template or documentation.

### Ready to file an Issue?

Before you file an issue, check:

* Is this the right repository? If you are trying to improve Moodle for example, this wouldn't be the place. 
* Check for existing issues. If the issue has already been created, update the issue and add your reaction to it with a up-vote or down-vote. 
* For bugs, provide as much detail as possible about what failed. Do not share secrets in the issue though. 

## Pull Requests

All contributions come through pull requests. 

It's OK to submit a PR directly for problems such as misspellings or other
things where the motivation/problem is unambiguous.

If there isn't an issue for your PR, please make an issue first and explain the
problem or motivation for the change you are proposing. When the solution isn't
straightforward, for example "Implement missing command X", then also outline
your proposed solution. Your PR will go smoother if the solution is agreed upon
before you've spent a lot of time implementing it.

To submit a proposed change, we recommend following this workflow:

1. Make sure there's an issue (bug or proposal) raised, which sets the expectations for the contribution you are about to make.
1. Fork the relevant repo and create a new branch
1. Create your change
    - Code changes require tests
1. Update relevant documentation for the change
1. Commit and open a PR
1. A maintainer of the project will be assigned, and you can expect a review within a few days
