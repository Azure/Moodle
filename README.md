# Deploy and Manage a Scalable Moodle Cluster on Azure

This repo contains guides on how to deploy and manage a scalable
[Moodle](https://moodle.com) cluster on Azure. You can use an [Azure
free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) to get started.

Once you have an Azure account you can deploy Moodle via the Azure
portal using the button below, or you can [deploy Moodle via the
CLI](docs/Deploy.md).

## What this stack will give you

This template set deploys the following infrastructure:
- Autoscaling web frontend layer (Nginx for https termination, Varnish for caching, Nginx/php-fpm or Apache/php)
- Private virtual network for frontend instances
- Controller instance running cron and handling syslog for the autoscaled site
- Load balancer to balance across the autoscaled instances
- Postgres or MySQL database
- Azure Redis instance for Moodle caching
- ObjectFS in Azure blobs (Moodle sitedata)
- Three Elasticsearch VMs for search indexing in Moodle
- Dual gluster nodes for high availability access to Moodle files
