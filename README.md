# Deploy and Manage a Scalable Moodle Cluster on Azure

This repo contains guides on how to deploy and manage a scalable
[Moodle](https://moodle.com) cluster on Azure. You can use an [Azure
free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) to get started.

Once you have an Azure account you can deploy Moodle via the Azure
portal using the button below, or you can [deploy Moodle via the
CLI](docs/Deploy.md).

## Minimal deployment

Try the following button if you'd like to deploy our templates with minimal resources.
All configurations are fixed and you just need to pass your ssh public key to the template
for logging in to the deployed VMs. This deployment will use NFS, Microsoft SQL, and
smaller autoscale web frontend VM sku (1 core) that'll give faster deployment time (less than
30 minutes) and requires only 3 VM cores currently that'll fit even in a free trial Azure subscription.

## Scalable and fully configurable deployment

The following button will allow you to specify various configurations for your Moodle cluster
deployment. The number of configuration options might be overwhelming, and we'll add more
detailed sizing guidelines in the future.

## What this stack will give you

This template set deploys the following infrastructure:
- Autoscaling web frontend layer (Nginx for https termination, Varnish for caching, Apache/php or nginx/php-fpm)
- Private virtual network for frontend instances
- Controller instance running cron and handling syslog for the autoscaled site
- Load balancer to balance across the autoscaled instances
- MS SQL, Postgres or MySQL database
- Azure Redis instance for Moodle caching
- ObjectFS in Azure blobs (Moodle sitedata)
- Three Elasticsearch VMs for search indexing in Moodle
- Dual gluster nodes for high availability access to Moodle files

## Quickstart

Why not get started with [deploying a Moodle cluster on
Azure](docs/Deploy.md) right now.

## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Our goal is to
work on Azure specific tooling for deploying and managing the open
source [Moodle](http://moodle.org) learning management system on
Azure. We do not work on Moodle itself here, instead we work upstream
as appropriate.

The short version of how to contribute to this project is "just do
it". Where "it" can be defined as any valuable contribution (and to be
clear, asking questions is a valuable contribution):

  * ask questions
  * provide feedback
  * write or update documentation
  * help new users
  * recommend the project to others
  * test the code and report bugs
  * fix bugs and issue pull requests
  * give us feedback on required features
  * write and update the software
  * create artwork
  * translate to different languages
  * anything you can see that needs doing

For a more detailed discussion of how to contribute see our [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTE.md).
